Tool is used to extract the named <database /> configuration from a support dump and import it to the specified databases.xml file.

Next iterations will export the database as an importable package.  
Also intend to develop a way to persist these packages and access them through a UI in order to import different database configurations based on tickets or customer.

--

Importable package includes:
metadata.xml
<database-name>.xml

Database config is similar to the support dump, adds 'links' and other xml entries
